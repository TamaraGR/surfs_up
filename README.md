## Analysis Results 

### Findings regarding June and December temperate

By filtering the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database we retreived all the temperature data for the months of June and December. Then we converted that data into lists and databased for June and December. After that we have generated summary statistics for the JUne and December datasets.
